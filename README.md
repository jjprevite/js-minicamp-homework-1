# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables
      -Think of a variable as an object we describe to the computer to remember for later. For example, if we want to tell the computer our age we could make a variable called 'myAge' so we might say 'var myAge = 12'.
	* Strings
      -Strings are words and sentences that the computer can read. They're usually written using letters and can also sometimes have numbers. For example, 'Hello world!' or 'apple' or 'I have 6 cats' are all strings. 
	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
      -A function is an action that we want the computer to execute or do for us. We include the 'formula' in the function then pass arguments through the function to get an answer. 
	* `if` statements
      -When we want the computer to do something based on certain conditions, we create an 'if statement' which says, 'Hey computer! If this is true/false, do this!' 
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)
      -this is one type of value in Javascript that is like a light switch. It can be either 'on' or 'off' depending on the where the switch is. In Javascript, a Boolean value can either be 'true' or 'false'.


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/


3. Install SublimeText3.  If you have another editor that you prefer then you can use that. https://www.sublimetext.com/3


4. Download this project folder from GitHub.


5. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.


6. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.


7. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
